I use `opencv` to match players onto their youtube highlights, and then create a formula used to rank players based on whether the NBA determines they're worth a highlight.\"\nauthor: \"Abhi Agarwal\"\ndate: \"2024-03-15\"\ncategories: [python, nba]\nfreeze: true\nfilters:\n  - optimize-images\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The NBA's youtube highlights\n\nThe NBA, since 2019, has conveniently put all of their in-game highlights on youtube. The NBA highlight sphere used to be dominated by accounts like FreeDawkins, so this was the NBA's attempt at sapping some of that advertising money for themselves.\n\n::: {#32644099 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nhighlight_playlists = {\n    \"2020\": \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVlyGVtvuVlr5GAksVQA37IE83MzRqln\",\n    \"2021\": \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVlyGVtvuVkIjURb-twQc1lsE4rT1wfJ\",\n    \"2022\": \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVlyGVtvuVm4_E_faSFuu3nU0F9O6XbR\",\n    \"2023\": \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVlyGVtvuVkAiuNG6gXxaUgjekofxxgs\",\n    #\"2024\": \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVlyGVtvuVkxr3RnRwVqtuWR7BSBE0tD\",\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nUsing `pytube`, we can get every single video from this. Let's convert it into a `polars` dataframe.\n\n::: {#4b596099 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# import pytube\n# import polars as pl\n\n# all_videos = []\n# for playlist_url in highlight_playlists.values():\n#     videos = [video async for video in pytube.Playlist(playlist_url).videos()]\n#     all_videos.append(videos)\n\n\n# highlights_df = pl.DataFrame(all_videos, schema=[\"video_title\", \"video_id\"])\n# display(highlights_df)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Scraping the headshots for all NBA players\n\nThe NBA makes it notoriously tricky to get headshots of old players. Twitter user [@NBA_University](https://twitter.com/NBA_University), who produces some awesome content, said he and his friends [figured out how to do this](https://twitter.com/NBA_University/status/1767927001661231222), but also said [he was gonna paywall it](https://twitter.com/NBA_University/status/1767948162746970497). Ok. I'm not gonna do that.\n\nAnyways, if you google \"nba player stats\" for any player, let's say for my boy Derrick White, it'll take you to a page [like this](https://www.nba.com/player/1628401/derrick-white). The image attached leads you to `https://cdn.nba.com/headshots/nba/latest/1040x760/1628401.png`. Pretty easy to see that this is an CDN that takes their \"player id\" and returns their latest headshot. Unfortunately, manipulating the \"latest\" to let's say, a 2023, leads to an \"access denied\" error.\n\nThankfully, I found a loophole. If you append the player's team id, documented [here](https://github.com/bttmly/nba/blob/master/data/teams.json), and then replace `latest` with the targeted year, you can find the headshot for the particular year. Here is Derrick White's 2019 headshot. `https://cdn.nba.com/headshots/nba/1610612759/2019/1040x760/1628401.png`\n\nThe upside is that headshots are now segregated by the `team id`. So Derrick White, who was traded from the San Antonio Spurs to the Boston Celtics in Feburary 2022 (which I will look on back as one of the best days of my life), has two headshots for 2021 â€” the San Antonio Spurs one (`https://cdn.nba.com/headshots/nba/1610612759/2021/1040x760/1628401.png`), and the Boston Celtics one (`https://cdn.nba.com/headshots/nba/1610612738/2021/1040x760/1628401.png`).\n\nI didn't store the headshots themselves in this repository, because it's a fuck-ton of space and also maybe illegal? No clue. But I did download a good chunk of them for this endeavor.\n\n---\njupyter:\n  kernelspec:\n    display_name: Python 3 (ipykernel)\n    language: python\n    name: python3\n    path: /Users/abhiagarwal/Developer/abhiaagarwal/.venv/share/jupyter/kernels/python3\n  language_info:\n    codemirror_mode:\n      name: ipython\n      version: 3\n    file_extension: .py\n    mimetype: text/x-python\n    name: python\n    nbconvert_exporter: python\n    pygments_lexer: ipython3\n    version: 3.12.2\n---\n",
