  abstract: >-
    "A hands-on, illuminating deconstruction of NBA basketball, tracing the
    tactical evolution of the modern game. As the NBA celebrates and surpasses
    75 years of existence, today's game looks nothing like it did in generations
    past when Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar took turns
    ruling the league. But it's also entirely different from a decade -- even
    half decade -- ago. Today's stars enter the league with more versatility and
    fluidity than ever before, and they need it to handle the strategies,
    philosophies, schemes, skill sets, movement patterns, and measures of
    basketball intelligence that simply didn't exist in the past. Spaced Out
    tells the story of what professional basketball looks like right now and how
    it got here. Taking a court-level view, Mike Prada breaks down high-level
    play to elucidate the athleticism, strategy, and skill demonstrated on a
    nighty basis, while shining a light on the historical forces that have
    dramatically altered the shape of the game and the role of its superstars.
    Topics covered include the explosion of three point shooting, the rise and
    fall and rise again of zone defense, the impact of tighter enforcement of
    perimeter contact rules, and other pivotal factors impacting the pro game.
    From Xs and Os to keen historic analysis, this definitive volume will reveal
    the intricacies of a beautiful game for savvy fans, players, and coaches
    alike." -- Provided by publisher
