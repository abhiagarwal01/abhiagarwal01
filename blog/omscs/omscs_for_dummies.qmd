Let me acknowledge the clickbait: I'm not actually a dummy by any means, as much as I love to self-deprecate. I graduated from a "prestigious" liberal arts college with a degree in mathematics, economics, and physics. I decided to become a software engineer because I ended up really liking money. I applied to OMSCS as a method to learn more â€” and to also make myself look more employable and thus get more money. Shallow, sure, but also honest. I'm entirely self-taught, having learned C++ from a family friend at the ripe age of 12^[which probably qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment per the Geneva Conventions]. I learned Python to help me do my math homework in high school and write silly little scripts. I've picked up a few languages like R, Stata, Rust, C# as I've wanted to expand my mind. I've always suffered from a healthy dose of imposter syndrome, OMSCS is my attempt to satiate this issue.

This is a diary of the classes I took in OMSCS, and how I felt about them, from the prespective of someone with very little formal programming experience. I wanted to document how OMSCS can feel for someone who is only one year removed from academia, but with little academic experience in software engineering. I will periodically update this throughout the years. Enjoy!
