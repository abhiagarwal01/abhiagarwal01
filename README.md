# Howdy ðŸ¤ !

I'm Abhi Agarwal, and I work with data for [SOPHiA Genetics](https://www.sophiagenetics.com/).

I code primarily in Python and Rust. I'm interested in software that can mathematically verify itself for both performance and security-critical applications.

I'm a lover of the NBA, and the Boston Celtics in particular. Talk to me about Jayson Tatum's statistical dominance in plus-minus, Marcus Smarts' continual ability to rise in the playoffs, or Al Horford being the most irreplacable role player in the league by providing elite rim protection and spacing. 

Or we can also talk about code or whatever, I guess.

You can find me on [Bluesky](https://staging.bsky.app/profile/abhi.rodeo). I also like to write sometimes, see what I have to say at [abhi.rodeo](https://abhi.rodeo) (yes, it's a legitimate TLD, I was also surprised!). Hope you find something you enjoy!
