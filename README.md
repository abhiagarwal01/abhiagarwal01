# Howdy ðŸ¤ !

I'm Abhi Agarwal, and I work as a Software Engineer for [SOPHiA Genetics](https://www.sophiagenetics.com/).

I code primarily in Python and Rust, with a focus on Spark. I'm interested in working with large data, storing it, and efficiently transforming it.

I'm a lover of the NBA and NFL, and my Boston Celtics and New England Patriots in particular. Talk to me about Jayson Tatum's statistical dominance in plus-minus, Marcus Smarts' continual ability to rise in the playoffs, or Al Horford being the most irreplacable role player in the league by providing elite rim protection and spacing. We can also talk about how Tom Brady is the GOAT and how Julian Edelman should probably be in the Hall of Fame.

Or we can also talk about code or whatever, I guess.
