# Hey, you there, hey, hey, you there

I'm Abhi Agarwal, and I'm a Data Engineer and Analyst for [SOPHiA Genetics](https://www.sophiagenetics.com/). 

I'm a lover of the NBA, and the Boston Celtics in particular. Talk to me about Jayson Tatum's statistical dominance in plus-minus, Marcus Smarts' continual ability to rise in the playoffs, or Derrick White's superstar-level impact. Or we can also talk about code or whatever, I guess.

You can find me on [Bluesky](https://staging.bsky.app/profile/abhi.rodeo). I also like to write sometimes, see what I have to say at [abhi.rodeo](https://abhi.rodeo) (yes, it's a legitimate TLD, I was also surprised!).
